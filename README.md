# MachineLearning
This repository contains my own implementations, in Python, of a famous online machine learning course. The implementation was done in python to add some challenge to the project. I chose the Jupyter notebooks because it allows to include Latex equations. 

To view the notebooks:
1. Go to the Jupyter Noteboks online viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ 
2. Paste the github link to the ipynb.
